I am planning to build a CLI tool that will suggest git commit message to the user based on the last commit in the branch or in the main branch and the current staged changes. The generated commit messages should be professional and maintain industry grade best practices. The messages will be generated using github models marketplace, (cause currently I do not have a better or free alternative).

act as a software developer engineer, product manager, open source project maintainer and builder with 15+ years of industry experience building CLI tools and using git and github. 

Based on your vast experience and hands on knowledge, improve this project idea mentioning all the loop holes and improvments and features that can also be integrated in this project. after that select the best tech stack that could be used to build this project and will be easier to ship to others and deploy. Also design the use case of the product and the user flow on the product.
ChatGPT said:

This is a great start! Before I dive into detailed improvements and tech stack suggestions, could you clarify a few points?

    Do you plan for the CLI tool to be used cross-platform (Linux, macOS, Windows)?

    Should it support multiple languages or only English commit messages?

    Are you planning to integrate this into GitHub workflows or keep it purely local for now?

    Will the tool run with or without internet (i.e., should it cache or queue requests for offline use)?

    Do you want the tool to support commit types like conventional commits (e.g., feat, fix, chore)?

    Should the user have the option to edit or choose from multiple suggestions before committing?

Answering these will help tailor a detailed and realistic roadmap, tech stack, and feature set.
You said:
1. yes the CLI should work cross-platform
2. It should only support English commit messages
3. I am planning it to run locally, but I do not know anything about github workflow and how it can be used in this project, could you ellaborate ?
4. Currently I do not want the user to use their local LLMs, so I do not know how the tool can run without internet, could you elloborate ?
5. Yes the tool need to strictly follow conventional and industry grade best practices around git commit messages.
6. The user might have the edit option, but I want there should be only one suggested commit message.

I want the commit message generation to be fast, very fast, cause the developer do not have the time to wait 1-2 mins for the commit message generation. 

Also could it be possible to use the tool with existing git commit command ?

like we use git commit -m 'commit msg', but what if we can use something like git commit -M then hit enter, then our tool generated the message, and then our user will hit enter again to complete the git commit. 
ChatGPT said:

Thanks! I’ll now develop a detailed technical and product plan for your CLI tool that:

    Generates professional, conventional-style Git commit messages in English using GitHub’s Model Marketplace

    Works cross-platform and locally (with internet)

    Enforces fast, single-suggestion commits with optional user editing

    Integrates with existing Git workflows (e.g., git commit -M)

I’ll also evaluate GitHub workflow integration options, potential offline modes, ideal tech stack, and outline user flows and advanced features.
I’ll get back to you shortly with a complete plan.

Git Commit Message Generator CLI Tool Design
AI-Powered Git Commit CLI: Design Improvements, Tech Stack, and Workflow

The proposed tool will be a cross-platform command‑line application that hooks into Git to generate professional commit messages using an AI model. Key improvements and safeguards include enforcing conventional commit style (type/scope prefix, imperative mood, concise summary)
medium.com
satellytes.com
, allowing the user a single suggested message (with optional edit), and warning about any sensitive data in the diff
medium.com
satellytes.com
. For example, the AI prompt can instruct the model to “use Conventional Commits style (feat, fix, chore, etc.), keep the subject ≤50 characters, use the imperative mood, and do not end with a period”
medium.com
. We will only generate English messages (per requirement) and explicitly tell the model to output English in the prompt. We should also recognize that AI has limits: as one study noted, such tools excel at summarizing what and how changed but often miss the why, so the developer should review and possibly add context
medium.com
github.com
. To enforce quality, the CLI can integrate a commit‐lint step (using tools like commitlint) to ensure format correctness
github.com
. Additionally, if the model detects secrets (keys, passwords) or oversized files in the staged diff, it should emit a warning instead of blindly including them in the message
medium.com
. In short, the tool’s features should include: one AI-generated suggestion, conventional style formatting, an option to abort or override, and clear guidelines to the model to ensure a professional, concise English commit message.
Recommended Tech Stack

For maximum portability the CLI should be cross-platform (Windows, macOS, Linux). Languages like Node.js (TypeScript) or Python are natural choices since they run anywhere and have rich libraries for Git and HTTP. In fact, existing tools (e.g. aicommits) are implemented in TypeScript
github.com
. Node/TypeScript has strong ecosystem support: CLI frameworks like Commander.js or Oclif can handle arguments, and libraries like simple-git (Node) or GitPython (Python) can read diffs/staging. A Node-based package can be published to npm, letting users install via npm install -g, which many developers already have set up. Alternatively, Rust or Go could be used to build a single static binary (no runtime needed) for all platforms
jimlynchcodes.com
jimlynchcodes.com
. Rust, for example, compiles to native machine code that runs identically on Windows, Linux, and macOS
jimlynchcodes.com
, and it has crates like git2 (libgit2) and argument parsers (Clap). Either way, the tool should include modules for:

    performing Git operations (e.g. staging, diff)

    sending HTTP requests (to call the AI model API)

    a CLI interface (parsing flags like the custom -M flag)

In summary, a Node.js/TypeScript stack is very practical (broad developer familiarity, easy npm distribution), though a compiled language like Rust/Go could yield faster startup and a single executable
jimlynchcodes.com
. For example, a Node CLI could use axios to call GitHub’s API and commander.js for commands, whereas a Rust CLI might use reqwest and clap.
Git Integration and Workflows

To integrate with normal Git workflows, the tool will hook into the commit process. For example, it can install itself as a Git prepare-commit-msg hook: after the user stages changes and runs git commit, the hook invokes our CLI, which captures the staged diff and generates a commit message. This is how the popular aicommits tool works: after running aicommits hook install, it “runs git diff to grab all your latest code changes, sends them to the AI model, then returns the AI generated commit message.”
github.com
. The hook then opens the editor so the user can review/edit the suggested message
github.com
medium.com
. In our tool, the workflow could be similar: the hook calls models.github.ai API and writes the response as the commit message template. Alternatively, we could create a Git alias or wrapper (e.g. a custom command like git commit -M) that runs our CLI, prints the suggestion, and then calls git commit -m "<suggestion>" when the user confirms. (Git itself has no native -M flag, but aliases using shell functions can simulate it.) In all cases the user would press Enter (or save/close the editor) to finalize the commit after seeing the AI-generated message
github.com
. Because we only give one suggestion, the UI is straightforward: the developer sees one draft message (in an editor or console) and can optionally edit it before completing the commit.

Regarding GitHub workflows: since this tool runs locally, continuous-integration workflows are not required for generation. However, GitHub Actions could still be used to enforce commit style after pushes (e.g. using commitlint or calling the GH Models API in a workflow step)
datacamp.com
. The key point is that our CLI will make a direct API call to GitHub’s AI endpoint (POST /inference/chat/completions) to generate the message. As the DataCamp guide explains, the request must include a GitHub token with models: read scope and a payload specifying the model (e.g. openai/gpt-4o) and the prompt messages
datacamp.com
. In practice the CLI would require the user to supply a GitHub Personal Access Token (PAT) with models:read permission, or rely on the gh CLI’s authentication. Because the GH Models run in the cloud (hosted by GitHub infrastructure
datacamp.com
), an internet connection is required to query them. If the user insisted on offline operation (no internet), the only workaround would be embedding a local LLM, which they have ruled out. Thus, we should design for online use and handle network failures gracefully (e.g. fall back or error if the API is unreachable).
Performance and Offline Considerations

Developers expect nearly instantaneous feedback. Commit message generation must be very fast (ideally a few seconds at most). To achieve this, the CLI should use a lightweight model or prompt, limit tokens, and make asynchronous calls so Git isn’t blocked too long. For example, using a model like gpt-3.5-turbo (instead of GPT-4) will reduce latency. The CLI can trim the diff to relevant context (e.g. git diff --staged --compact-summary) or break it into a concise prompt with a system instruction. Caching previous similar diffs is complex and likely unnecessary if the model is fast enough. If the AI call does take longer, the CLI should show a spinner or message so the user knows it is working.

Because the user forbids local LLMs, the only option without internet is to decline generation. The tool can detect offline status: if no connection, it could either abort or generate a minimal human-friendly message (e.g. “[User offline – commit message not generated]”). In practice, our design assumes network access to GitHub’s API. (Note: one could consider using a local embedding model like Ollama for offline AI, but that violates the “no local LLM” requirement.)
Commit Best Practices Enforcement

The tool must strictly follow industry best practices for commit messages. We will adopt the Conventional Commits standard (type/scope/description)
satellytes.com
. For example, commit subjects should start with feat: or fix:, etc., optionally include a scope (in parentheses), then a concise description
satellytes.com
. The CLI prompt will instruct the model accordingly (e.g. “Write a commit subject with feat(...)/fix(...), imperative mood, and a short description.”). We’ll enforce the imperative mood (“Add”, “Fix”, not “Added”)
satellytes.com
, a 50‑character‑or‑less summary
medium.com
, and professional tone
medium.com
. Any body text should wrap at ~72 characters and explain why the change was made (though the model may need help on that). After generation, we can optionally run a commit lint check to catch any violations (e.g. disallowed types or lengths) before finalizing the commit
github.com
. If the generated message violates rules, the tool can alert the user or regenerate with a stricter prompt.
User Flow and Example

A typical developer flow will be:

    Stage changes (e.g. git add .).

    Invoke commit (e.g. git commit -M or simply git commit if using a hook).

    The CLI captures the diff (and optionally the last commit message for context), then constructs a prompt. The prompt might say: “You are a Git expert writing a commit message. The staged diff shows X changes in files Y. Generate a Conventional-Commits style message in English: a short imperative summary (<50 chars) plus an optional body.” It may also include instructions to flag secrets
    medium.com
    .

    The tool calls the GitHub Models API with that prompt. The model returns a commit subject (and body).

    The CLI presents the suggestion to the user. For example, if using a hook, it fills the editor with the suggested text
    github.com
    ; if using a custom command, it prints it for confirmation.

    The developer reviews/edits the message (if needed) and presses Enter or saves. Only one suggestion is shown per commit, as requested.

    Git finalizes the commit with that message.

This integrates seamlessly with existing workflows. The user still types git commit as usual (or our alias), sees the suggested message, and hits enter. Under the hood, our CLI does the AI work with minimal extra steps.

Example: Suppose a developer has changed auth.js and fixed a typo. After staging, they run git commit -M. Our CLI grabs the diff, sends it to the model, and might return:

feat(auth): fix typo in logout error handling  

The CLI then asks “Accept this commit message?” and on confirmation runs git commit -m "feat(auth): fix typo in logout error handling". The whole process takes only a few seconds, saving the developer time and ensuring the message follows conventions.

the research done by yourself is aweasome. we can definitely go with this plan. Till now we are not thinking about linking any local LLMs but in future we can provide the option to the user to add their own local LLMs. Now, as we are going to use GitHub hosted ai models, we need a github access token with model:read access, but all the tokens have their limits, so what will be the best plan ? using my GAT or prompt the user to enter their own github access tokens ? 

Also, how I can remotely control which AI Model should used by the tool in the users computer ? 

The sensitive key or information detection feature is very innovative and we should definitely use it. 

and for tech stack, lets use nodejs. and keep in mind that the tool should be interactive. 

additionally, using prompt engineering; craft a detailed prompt asking an ai agent to build this project end to end; with all the discussed features and suggestion that you gave after the research.

Great follow-up! Let me address your open questions and then craft a full prompt engineering spec you can hand to an AI agent to build the project end to end.
🔑 GitHub Access Token Strategy

    Do NOT ship your own token
    If you use your own GitHub access token (GAT), it will get abused, hit rate limits, and could even be revoked. It’s also a security risk if embedded in a distributed CLI.

    Best practice:

        Prompt the user to provide their own GitHub Personal Access Token (PAT) with models:read scope.

        Support two paths:

            Environment variable (e.g. GITHUB_TOKEN or AI_COMMIT_TOKEN).

            First-run interactive setup that stores the token in a secure keychain (or in a config file like ~/.aicommit/config.json).

        Optionally, if the user already has the gh CLI installed and authenticated, you can read the token from there.

👉 This way, each user manages their own quota and avoids dependency on your personal API limits.
🔄 Remote Control of AI Model Choice

You want flexibility to switch models later (e.g., gpt-3.5 for speed vs. gpt-4o for quality). Options:

    Config File

        Store a config in ~/.aicommit/config.json.

        Example:

        { "model": "gpt-4o-mini" }

        On startup, the CLI reads this file.

        You can publish updates recommending which model is optimal, but the user can override.

    Remote Config (optional, advanced)

        Host a small JSON file on GitHub (e.g., https://your-org.github.io/aicommit/config.json).

        On startup, your CLI fetches this file (with caching) and uses the recommended model.

        Users can override via local config if they want.

        This gives you centralized control over model defaults.

⚡ Interactive CLI

Since you’re set on Node.js:

    Use TypeScript.

    CLI framework: Commander.js

(lightweight) or Oclif

(if you want more scaffolding).

For interactive flows: Inquirer.js

(e.g., confirm commit message).

For Git: simple-git

    .

    For API calls: axios or fetch.

🤖 Prompt for AI Agent (to build this project end-to-end)

Here’s a carefully engineered prompt you can feed into an AI code generation agent:

Prompt:

You are an expert software engineer with 15+ years of experience building cross-platform CLI tools and open-source developer utilities.

Your task: Design and implement an interactive CLI tool in Node.js (TypeScript) that generates professional Git commit messages using GitHub’s Models Marketplace API.
Requirements

    Core Features

        Generate commit messages in English only.

        Enforce Conventional Commits format:

            Types: feat, fix, chore, docs, style, refactor, perf, test, ci, build.

            Optional scope in parentheses.

            Imperative mood, max 50 characters in subject, no trailing period.

        One AI-generated suggestion per commit, not multiple choices.

        Allow the user to edit or accept the message before finalizing.

        Detect sensitive info in the staged diff (keys, tokens, passwords) and warn if found.

        Must be fast: aim for <5s per generation.

    GitHub Models API Integration

        Use the endpoint: POST /inference/chat/completions with model name (e.g., gpt-4o-mini).

        Authentication: via GitHub Personal Access Token (PAT) with models:read scope.

        Token management:

            First-time setup: ask user for token interactively.

            Save securely (e.g., config file at ~/.aicommit/config.json).

            Also support environment variable GITHUB_TOKEN.

            Optionally detect if gh CLI is installed and reuse its auth.

        Include a system prompt enforcing Conventional Commits rules and professional tone.

    Git Integration

        Work as a prepare-commit-msg Git hook (auto-fills commit template).

        Support a custom command: git commit -M that:

            Runs the CLI.

            Shows the generated message.

            On confirmation, executes git commit -m "<message>".

    Configuration

        Config file ~/.aicommit/config.json supporting:

            Default model (model: "gpt-4o-mini").

            Flags (e.g., alwaysAskBeforeCommit).

        Future-proofing: allow users to add a custom API endpoint for local LLMs later.

    Interactive UX

        Use Commander.js for CLI commands.

        Use Inquirer.js for interactive confirmation (e.g., “Accept commit message?”).

        Show a spinner while waiting for AI response.

        On error (offline, bad token, API fail), fall back gracefully:

            Warn the user.

            Optionally generate a minimal commit like “chore: update files”.

    Security

        Never log the user’s token.

        Warn the user if sensitive data is found in diffs.

        Obey .gitignore rules when scanning files.

    Performance

        Use concise diffs (git diff --staged --compact-summary).

        Limit prompt size to avoid long latencies.

        Optimize for speed first, then completeness.

    Packaging & Distribution

        Publish as npm package: aicommit-cli.

        Single command: aicommit.

        Global install via npm install -g aicommit-cli.

        Include a hook install subcommand to set up Git hooks.

Deliverables

    Complete TypeScript CLI implementation.

    Clear folder structure (src/cli.ts, src/git.ts, src/api.ts, src/config.ts, src/security.ts).

    Unit tests for parsing, config, and commit linting.

    Documentation (README.md) with install/setup instructions.

    Example usage flows:

        git commit -M

        aicommit hook install

        aicommit config set model gpt-4o-mini

⚡ Goal: Build a production-ready CLI that saves developers time, enforces best commit practices, and integrates seamlessly with Git.

Got it ✅ — you want a short, simple, easy-to-pronounce, SEO-friendly product name that will rank well if someone searches “git commit” on Google.

Here are the best options after balancing SEO + clarity + memorability:
🔥 Top Recommendation

gitcommit.ai

    Dead simple, instantly clear what it does.

    SEO-friendly: literally matches the search keyword “git commit” plus .ai.

    Easy to say, easy to spell, professional.

    Strong branding potential (domain likely available in some form).

Other Strong Options

    CommitAI

        Very short and memorable.

        Clear focus on commit messages with AI.

    AutoCommit

        Easy to recall, slightly broader but still relevant.

    SmartCommit

        Emphasizes intelligence and professionalism.

    CommitCraft

        Developer-friendly, has a “crafted with care” feel.

Why gitcommit.ai is Best

    Exact keyword match (git commit) = maximum SEO boost.

    Adding .ai makes it modern, shows AI-power explicitly.

    Developers searching “git commit AI” or “AI git commit message generator” will likely see this near the top.

    It’s unique and project-ready.

👉 My vote: gitcommit.ai as the official name.

Would you like me to also propose a project title and description (like the ones you’d use in a “Projects” dashboard or README) based on this name?

okay so we will use the user's own github access token; advanced remote config approach to make necessary changes; ofetch instead of axios
ChatGPT said:

Perfect ✅ — so let’s lock in the plan with your updates:
🔑 GitHub Access Token Handling

    We will always use the user’s own GitHub Access Token (with models:read scope).

    Supported ways:

        Environment variable: GITHUB_TOKEN (or fallback AI_COMMIT_TOKEN).

        First-run interactive setup:

            Prompt for token.

            Save securely in ~/.gitcommit/config.json (or ~/.config/gitcommit/config.json on Linux).

        Optional: If gh CLI is installed and authenticated, read token from there for convenience.

This ensures:

    No shared quota.

    No risk of your personal token being leaked.

    Users remain in control of their API usage.

🔄 Remote Config (Advanced Model Control)

We’ll implement remote config fetching, so you can adjust defaults later without forcing every user to update:

    On startup, the CLI fetches a small JSON config from a hosted file (e.g. https://gitcommit.ai/config.json).

    Example remote config:

    {
      "defaultModel": "gpt-4o-mini",
      "minVersion": "1.2.0",
      "messages": {
        "warning": "We recommend upgrading for better performance."
      }
    }

    Cache locally (e.g. for 24h) to avoid slowing down every run.

    Allow local overrides in ~/.gitcommit/config.json, so power users can pin their own model.

This gives you a “kill switch” and flexibility to test faster/cheaper models later.
🌐 ofetch instead of axios

    We’ll use ofetch

    (from the Nuxt/UnJS ecosystem).

    Advantages:

        Small, modern, and lightweight.

        Promise-based API, almost identical to fetch.

        Built-in JSON response parsing.

        Tree-shakeable (ideal for CLI apps where package size matters).

Example usage in our CLI:

import { ofetch } from 'ofetch';

async function callGitHubModel(token: string, prompt: string) {
  const response = await ofetch('https://api.github.com/inference/chat/completions', {
    method: 'POST',
    headers: {
      Authorization: `Bearer ${token}`,
      'Content-Type': 'application/json',
    },
    body: {
      model: 'gpt-4o-mini',
      messages: [
        { role: 'system', content: 'You are an expert at writing Conventional Commit messages...' },
        { role: 'user', content: prompt },
      ],
    },
  });

  return response.choices?.[0]?.message?.content?.trim();
}

⚡ Next step: I can draft the exact system prompt we should send to GitHub Models (with rules for Conventional Commits, English-only, professional tone, sensitive info detection).

Do you want me to write that system prompt now?

To tailor the prompt for your AI agent, could you confirm which AI platform or agent you'll be using to build this (e.g., ChatGPT, Claude, Copilot Workspace, etc.)? Also, do you want the AI to generate only the core CLI code, or should it also include setup scripts, documentation, and packaging (like npm publish setup)?

Great — here's a detailed Claude-friendly prompt to build your AI-powered Git commit message generator CLI tool from end to end, including setup, packaging, and documentation.

Claude Prompt to Build AI Git Commit CLI Tool
Project Idea and Key Improvements

The goal is a cross-platform CLI tool that automatically generates a high-quality, conventional-commit-style message from the staged diff and recent commits. In practice, the tool would run locally (invoked via a special git commit alias or hook), collect the current staged changes (git diff) and relevant context (e.g. the last commit on the branch or main), and call an LLM to craft a concise, imperative commit message. Commit messages should follow industry best practices – e.g. Conventional Commits with a clear type/scope:description header and optional body
graphite.dev
github.com
. For example, a message might be fix(auth): validate password on login form. The tool must enforce short, present-tense, imperative phrasing
github.com
and only one suggestion (as requested), though the user could still edit it if needed.

Potential pitfalls and improvements:

    Performance & Responsiveness: Calling a remote LLM (even a fast model) can take several seconds. To make generation fast (<5s), the tool should send only the essential context (staged diff plus maybe one previous commit message) rather than the entire repo. Using a lightweight model (e.g. a smaller GPT-4 variant) or an optimized prompt (one-shot summary) can reduce latency. Caching common prompt templates and using streaming APIs may help, but network calls are required. If the user truly needs offline mode, a local model (like Ollama or Llama) would be needed, but per requirements we will rely on cloud models. Thus, the tool requires internet to query the GitHub model endpoint; without internet, it cannot generate messages.

    Conventional Commits Format: The tool should strictly follow Conventional Commits. This means formatting the header as <type>(<scope>): <description> and optionally adding a multi-line body or footers (e.g. BREAKING CHANGE) if needed
    graphite.dev
    . To ensure this, the prompt to the LLM can instruct it on the format, or the tool can validate the output with a linter (e.g. commitlint). The set of commit types should cover common categories (feat, fix, docs, style, refactor, perf, test, chore)
    graphite.dev
    . Features to detect scope (e.g. “parser” or “UI”) could be added, or allow the user to specify a preferred type/scope if the diff is ambiguous. For example, if the branch name or last commit message includes a JIRA ticket or module name, prefill the scope.

    Single Suggestion Policy: Since the user wants only one suggestion, the tool should generate exactly one candidate message per run. (Internally, it could ask for multiple but pick the top one before showing it.) The tool can still allow the user to edit that message before final commit (for example, open the default editor with the suggestion or prompt for confirmation). This balances automation with control. Existing tools (like aicommits or ai-commit) often allow multiple choices or interactive editing, but we can simplify to one suggestion by default
    github.com
    .

    Integration with Git Workflow: We can integrate by offering a custom Git alias or hook. For example, define an alias such as git config alias.cmt '!ai-commit', so the user types git cmt instead of git commit -m. Alternatively, a prepare-commit-msg hook could auto-populate the commit message file when a commit is initiated. Another option is to override a flag: e.g. git commit -M could be an alias for git commit that runs our generator. In either case, the workflow is: user stages changes (git add), then invokes commit (with our tool), the tool generates the message and either automatically passes it to git commit -m "<message>" or opens the editor for final review, and then the commit completes
    github.com
    . Importantly, if the user manually supplies a message (e.g. via -m), the tool should skip auto-generation and let the user message stand.

    Professional Tone & Content: The LLM prompt should be engineered to produce a concise summary of changes and their motivation. It should avoid fluff and gibberish. For example, it should extract from the diff: “Added validation for password field to fix null-pointer error”, rather than something vague. We might include guardrails like “write in third person, present tense” and “follow Conventional Commits format” in the prompt. Existing guidance suggests imperative, descriptive messages help others understand history
    github.com
    . We should also ensure consistency: if the last commit on the branch was a feat type, the next might also be a feat if it’s the same logical change; the tool can look at the last commit message for hints.

    Additional Features: Beyond basic generation, the tool could optionally support (for future versions):

        Hooks for Enforcement: Integrate with commitlint or gitlint to validate that the message meets style rules (Conventional Commit style) before finalizing.

        Scope Detection: Try to auto-detect scope from file paths (e.g. changes under auth/ -> (auth) scope).

        Configuration File: Let projects specify conventions (e.g. allowed types, scopes, or a template) in a config file.

        Gitmoji or Emoticons: Some teams like emoji prefixes; we could offer an optional --emoji flag (like in ai-commit) to append an emoji for fun.

        CI/CD Hook: Optionally provide a GitHub Action or pre-commit hook that checks commit messages on PRs to ensure they adhere to the tool’s conventions, but this is extra.

        Extensibility: Leave open the ability to switch LLM providers (GitHub models marketplace is default, but the design could allow plugging in other APIs later).

Tech Stack and Architecture

Given the requirements (cross-platform CLI, ease of distribution, integration with Git/LLM API), a good stack would be:

    Implementation Language: Node.js (TypeScript) or Python are natural choices. Both have rich ecosystems for CLI tools and Git integration. For example, the popular aicommits and cmai tools are written in Node/TypeScript, demonstrating viability. Python (with Click or Typer) is also an option but distributing executables on Windows can be trickier. Alternatively, a compiled language like Go or Rust yields single executables for each platform (good for distribution), but development is slower. Node/TypeScript may be “easier to ship” via npm install -g or packaging tools (pkg/nexe), and many developers already have Node installed.

    CLI Framework: If using Node, use Oclif or Commander.js for robust command parsing. For Python, Click or Typer. These help build commands, flags (e.g. --force or --type), and handle cross-platform differences.

    Git Integration: Use the child_process (Node) or subprocess (Python) to call Git commands (git diff, git rev-parse --abbrev-ref HEAD, etc.) to get the diff and branch info. This approach is simple and reliable across platforms. Alternatively, libgit2 bindings exist, but calling Git CLI is straightforward.

    GitHub Models API: To call the GitHub LLM marketplace, one can use GitHub’s REST or GraphQL API. The LangChain GithubLLM integration shows how GitHub provides an endpoint supporting models like gpt-4o
    github.com
    . In practice, the tool will require the user’s GitHub Personal Access Token (set via an env var, e.g. GITHUB_TOKEN). A simple HTTP client (axios in Node, requests in Python) can POST to GitHub’s API (endpoint documented by GitHub) to get a completion. GitHub’s LLM API uses the user’s token for authentication and currently offers free usage in limited beta
    github.com
    . We should include instructions for obtaining and configuring this token. Error handling (API failures, rate limits) must be robust.

    Packaging & Distribution: For Node, publish as an npm package so users can install via npm or yarn. Also use a bundler like pkg or nexe to produce standalone binaries for Linux/Mac/Windows; alternatively provide install scripts. For Python, distribute via PyPI and instruct pip install, or use PyInstaller for binaries. If going Go, cross-compile to platform binaries and provide downloads. The installer should also configure the Git alias/hook automatically (similar to how cmai provides an install script) so users can immediately use git commit with the AI tool.

    Cross-Platform Concerns: Ensure any shell scripts or hooks work on Windows (PowerShell/Bash) as well as Unix. Many Node tools assume a Bash-like environment; for full Windows support, consider using cmd or bundling a Git Bash script. Document clearly any shell requirements (like using Git Bash on Windows). Node and Python themselves run on all platforms. Using a CLI framework and Node’s os module can handle path issues. (For example, cmai advertises Windows, Linux, macOS support out of the box
    github.com
    .)

    Dependencies: Minimize heavy deps. Only require a JSON HTTP client (for the API), a CLI helper library, and possibly a YAML/JSON parser for config. Commitlint or similar could be an optional dev dependency if validating commits.

    Avoiding Local LLM Requirement: Since we won’t bundle a local model, the tool must talk to the cloud. That means internet access and a valid token. We should clarify this: “running locally” means the binary runs on the developer’s machine, but it will call GitHub’s remote LLM API. Without internet or a token, the tool cannot generate a message. (If offline support is desired later, the codebase could be extended to detect a local LLM server like Ollama or LMStudio, but that’s beyond the current scope.)

Use Case and User Flow

    Developer Prepares Changes: The developer edits code, stages files (git add .) as usual.

    Invoke Commit Command: Instead of git commit -m "...", they run our tool, for example via an alias like git commit-m or a new command gcomet. The tool could be invoked as git commit -M (using a Git alias) or simply as gcomet if installed globally.

    Diff Collection: The tool runs git diff --cached (or git diff main...HEAD on a feature branch) to collect the staged changes. It also fetches context such as the most recent commit message on this branch or the target branch (main), and the branch name if relevant.

    Generate Prompt and Call LLM: It constructs a prompt that says something like “The following code changes are staged. Write a concise git commit message in Conventional Commits format (type(scope): description) summarizing what changed and why. Use imperative mood. Only output the commit message.” Then it sends this prompt (with the diff and context) to GitHub’s LLM endpoint using the chosen model (e.g. gpt-4o-mini for speed).

    Receive Suggested Message: The API returns one commit message string. (We requested exactly one.) For example, it might return feat(parser): add null-check on user input.

    Review/Edit (Optional): The tool then displays this suggestion to the user. It could automatically open the user’s $EDITOR with the message pre-filled, or simply show the text on the console and ask “Press Enter to accept, or edit.” Because we want only one suggestion by default, we’ll assume acceptance or minor editing. (For example, existing tools open the editor so the user can tweak the AI output
    github.com
    .)

    Finalize Commit: Once the user confirms or saves edits, the tool runs git commit -m "<final message>" to complete the commit. If the tool was invoked via git commit -M, the alias or script will effectively supply the message to Git and then exit, finishing the commit with the AI-generated message.

    Post-Conditions: The commit is made with a properly formatted message. Optionally, if configured, the tool could automatically push the commit, or the user can push as usual. The tool then exits.

Throughout this flow, the goal is that the developer spends minimal extra time: they don’t wait minutes for generation (by tuning prompts and model choice), and they get a polished message with a single accept click. Since editing is optional and the default is a good suggestion, it should speed up commit writing.

In summary, this CLI tool wraps the normal git commit step: it intercepts the commit invocation, generates a best-practice message via the GitHub LLM API, shows it to the user, and then passes it to git commit. This maintains a familiar Git workflow (staging + commit) while ensuring consistent, professional commit messages
